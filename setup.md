## Configuring The Power

### Prerequisites
* Linux/Mac/GitHub Codespace
* A GitHub Enterprise Server or dotcom org with a Enterprise admin user name and password 
* A `jq` command on your client:

#### A note about Bash

A few scripts use arrays in bash and for those you'll need to have bash 5.x. The bash delivered on Mac OS is 3.2 so `brew install bash` may be needed if you want to use scripts that contain `declare -A` then you can use `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash`. These scripts were tested with 5.2.37 on Mac:

```
bash --version
GNU bash, version 5.2.37(1)-release (aarch64-apple-darwin24.0.0)
Copyright (C) 2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
```

#### jq

```
brew install jq
```

#### Python
  
* A Python >3.6 interpreter on your Mac.

####  Ruby & Ruby Gems 
Use the 'brew" version of ruby not the much older version as delivered on Mac OS X. This one seems to work well:

```
ruby 3.4.2 (2025-02-15 revision d2930f8e7a) +PRISM [arm64-darwin24]
```

* The [JWT Rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jwt) required for [GitHub App authentication](https://github.com/gm3dmo/the-power/blob/main/docs/setting-up-a-gh-app.md#using-a-github-app-with-the-power):

```
sudo gem install jwt
```

#### Personal Access Token (PAT)
* [Create your token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). In GitHub Enterprise (give it all the scopes. Be careful and give the token an expiry date if running on GitHub.com. Strongly recommend a token with short expiry time. If you find yourself creating a lot of tokens on a regular basis, then this tip for [selecting all checkboxes on](https://gist.github.com/gm3dmo/e085294a622c1c72eec0e8b48d72b092) may be useful.

### Configure The Power with `configure.py`

### Client side setup
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gm3dmo/the-power/releases/latest).
- Unzip the release file to a directory of your choice.
- Change into the the directory and version of the power.
- Run [`configure.py`](/configure.py) to generate the `.gh-api-examples.conf` file. This file feeds variables to the scripts in The Power.:

```bash
python3 configure.py
```

`configure.py` asks questions, You need to provide your token and hostname of your
GHE server or enter `api.github.com` if you are using GitHub.com enter `api.github.com` as the hostname.

```
Enter GHE Hostname: myserver.example.com
Enter token: ***cc2d128a
```

* If you want a different team name,  you can edit  `.gh-api-examples.conf` with an editor of your choice.


### `configure.py` can run without interaction from the command line:
Non-interactive values can be specified on the command line in order to use The Power in a custom automation:

```
python3 configure.py --hostname myserver.example.com \
                     --token ghp_****************************wh3Ybleu \
                     --webhook-url https://events.hookdeck.com/e/src_1hm2RSyiguMW
```
The `--primer` flag may also be of interest. Provide the name of a primer script which will be executed when `configure.py` is complete.

Optionally, edit  `.gh-api-examples.conf` to add any extra customizations you want to support.


### Applying a build to a GHE server

```
bash build-all.sh
```
